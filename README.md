# solar-moon-public

This is the project for the public facing website for solar moon analytics.

The project is built in react and does not require any further server-side APIs to load. It is intended to be deployed
directly to an S3 bucket and served from there or via cloudfront.

### Building

Scripts to build, deploy and rollback exist, see [solar-moon-server-config/website](https://github.com/bigboxer23/solar-moon-server-config/tree/main/scripts/website)
